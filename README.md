# Greengrocers
Greengrocers is a project which explores a common scenario in eCommerce, adding and removing items from the cart, and calculating the total. This project was one of my favourite during my time studying Software Developing at Boolean. We were given a list of user stories and some resources to work from and were tasked at recreating this;

This was one of the first full dynamic sites I created which used shared state. This app was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It was really fun making an app this way. I have also recreated this app using React which can also be found on my GitHub. But I remember feeling a great sense of achievement when I built this app the first time so this is why I`m showing this version in my portfolio.
